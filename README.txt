Tango
--------
A very simple SMB/CIFS filesharing client for Apple's iOS platform.
It is the filesharing protocol of Microsoft Windows.
It is not nearly complete and at the moment it only has the following features:
* Connect to a password-protected network share
* Password enryption (only weak LM2 challenge/response)
* Browse directory contents

The library comes with a simple iPhone app to test the library.
